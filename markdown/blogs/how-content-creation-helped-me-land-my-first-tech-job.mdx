Getting the first job is the hardest. It is also frustrating when you apply for countless jobs but don't hear back.

Even if you get a call back you have to face countless meetings and assessments.

But, it doesnâ€™t have to be that way.

Nowadays, you can build your presence on social media. It shows what you are capable of doing.

That way instead of you applying for the job, the job will find you!

In this article, I will share my story of how I managed to land my first job by creating content.

So, letâ€™s get started.

### The Beginning

In the beginning, I started with the traditional approach. Applying to hundreds of jobs and never getting a callback.

Even If I got a few callbacks, I would get an assessment, and after I submitted they would never call (Skill issues ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£)

So, I was going nowhere. Then I decided not to apply and do the assessment for free. I started to create videos on YouTube and write articles (I had free time I could do all).

Then I would share my videos and articles on Twitter.

While doing all these I was taking freelance projects here and there.

### The Big day

As I focused on creating and sharing content, something unexpected happened. I received a call from a potential employer, who found my work online.

Initially, I thought it was a friend, but it turned out to be a job opportunity.

They asked me to create a video for their product.

After creating a video for their product, they offered me a position as a Support Engineer. I started part-time, handling client queries and updating documentation.

Two months later, I transitioned to a front-end developer role in the same company.

### Creating Content

Now, you might be wondering what type of content to create. It doesn't have to be complicated.

If you love being in front of a camera you can create videos, if you donâ€™t like that you can start a blog.

If blogging sounds too much effort start by tweeting.

Once you choose the platform your question might be what should I write/create videos about?

Here are a few ideas to get you started:

1. Build projects and write about them.
2. Write about the problem you solved.
3. Share what you learn every day.
4. Write about a book you read.
5. Share your take on a new tech.

The ideas are endless. You just have to start.

Once you start creating content you will get endless ideas.

Donâ€™t forget to share your content on Twitter or any other social media you are active on.

### Conclusion

If you are applying for jobs and going nowhere, then try this approach.

Improve your skills and create content. Your content doesnâ€™t have to be perfect. You have to start. Day by day you will get good at it.

Start today and share your content in the comment section, even if itâ€™s just a tweet or a simple article.

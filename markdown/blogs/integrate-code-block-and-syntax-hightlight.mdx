We built a complete blog with Sanity but don’t have support for code input and syntax highlight. 

So, today we will integrate code input and syntax highlight on our blog.

Let’s get started. 

### Install the package

To enable code input on Sanity Studio install the sanity/code-input package

```jsx
npm install @sanity/code-input

or

yarn add @sanity/code-input
```

For syntax highlight install react-syntax-highlighter

```jsx
npm install react-syntax-highlighter

or

yarn add react-syntax-highlighter 
```

### Add the plugin

Once the installation is complete, add the plugin to the sanity.config.ts file.

```jsx

import { codeInput } from "@sanity/code-input";

const config = defineConfig({
  //..
  plugins: [structureTool(), codeInput()],
  schema: { types: schemas },
});

export default config;

```

### Update the Schema

To enable code code input we need to update the BlockContent Schema.

Open up **blockContent.ts** file from **sanity→schemas** and add the Code Block schema in the array. 

```jsx
const blockContent = {
  title: "Block Content",
  name: "blockContent",
  type: "array",
  of: [
    ...
    
    {
      type: "code",
      name: "code",
      title: "Code Blocks",
      options: {
        languageAlternatives: [
          { title: "", value: "" },
          { title: "Javascript", value: "javascript" },
          { title: "HTML", value: "html" },
          { title: "CSS", value: "css" },
          { title: "React", value: "react" },
          { title: "Node", value: "node" },
          { title: "MySql", value: "mysql" },
          { title: "ZH", value: "zh", mode: "sh" },
        ],
        withFilename: false,
      },
    },
  ],
};
export default blockContent;

```

This will enable the code block option on the block content editor.

Now you can add code snippets to your blog posts.

To add a code snippet click the **Code Blocks** button and enter your code. 

Choose the language from the drop-down menu. Once you are done, close the modal, which will save the code snippet.

We have the code snippet on the post body, but it will not appear on the post because the code snippet is unknown to the RenderBodyContent component. 

We have to update the RenderBodyContent component to render the code snippet. 

### Update RenderBodyContent component

To render the code snippet import these on top of the file. 

```jsx
import SyntaxHighlighter from "react-syntax-highlighter";
import { dracula } from "react-syntax-highlighter/dist/esm/styles/hljs";
```

Then create the **Code** component as shown below:

```jsx
const Code = ({ value }: any) => {
  return (
    <div className="my-10">
      <SyntaxHighlighter language={value.language} style={dracula}>
        {value.code}
      </SyntaxHighlighter>
    </div>
  );
};
```

Finally, update the components with code components. 

```jsx
const components = {
  types: {
    image: ImageComponent,
    code: Code,
  },
};
```

This will generate the code snippet on the post. 

This is how it looks:

If you want to change the theme you can do that very easily. 

Just import the theme of your choice and update the style.

```jsx
import { dark } from "react-syntax-highlighter/dist/esm/styles/hljs";
```

```jsx
const Code = ({ value }: any) => {
  return (
    <div className="my-10">
      <SyntaxHighlighter language={value.language} style={dark}>
        {value.code}
      </SyntaxHighlighter>
    </div>
  );
};
```

Internationalization (i18n) is a crucial feature for any modern web application that seeks to reach a global audience. It enables you to deliver content in various languages, making your application accessible and user-friendly to people from different linguistic backgrounds.

In today’s guide, you will learn how to integrate internationalization to a Next.js application using `next-intl`.

Let’s get started.

### Prerequisite

To make the most out of this guide, here’s what you should have under your belt:

1. Understanding of Next.js app router and TypeScript.
2. Knowledge of how Next.js Middleware works.

## Install Next.js

To integrate multi-language support you need a Next.js project.

Let’s create a brand new project with create-next-app.

```jsx
npx create-next-app@latest
```

Run the above command and go with all the default options. You can choose the options according to your requirements.

Once you are done, you will have the Next.js project ready to integrate multi-language support.

## Write the Translations

Before we proceed to configure `next-intl` we need the translation for the different languages.

We will keep all the translations in the **messages** folder. You can name it anything you want.

Translations are stored as JSON objects. We only have a title for this example.

Go ahead and add all your text and their corresponding translations in these files.

## Configure next-intl

First, you have to install next-intl

Run this command to install the package:

```jsx
npm install next-intl
```

Once done, create a new route named [locale] inside the app directory.

And move all the routes under [locale], we will use this to get the locale and show the text in that language.

Now that we have all set up, let’s configure next-intl.

**#1:** Create a config file on the root of your project's directory and name it: **i18n.ts.**

Paste this code snippet into that file:

```jsx
import { notFound } from "next/navigation";
import { getRequestConfig } from "next-intl/server";

export const locales = ["en", "de", "fr"];

export default getRequestConfig(async ({ locale }) => {
  // Validate that the incoming `locale` parameter is valid
  if (!locales.includes(locale as any)) notFound();

  return {
    messages: (await import(`../messages/${locale}.json`)).default,
  };
});

```

In this code snippet, set up the locales for your project and validate the incoming locale parameter. If the locale is not on your list, redirect it to the not-found page. If it matches one of the locales, return the message for that locale.

**#2**: Create **middleware.ts** file on the root of your project.

Copy this code snippet over to your middleware

```jsx
import createMiddleware from "next-intl/middleware";
import { locales } from "./i18n";

export default createMiddleware({
  // A list of all locales that are supported
  locales: locales,

  // Used when no locale matches
  defaultLocale: "en",
  // Removes the locale when it's default
  localePrefix: "as-needed",
});

export const config = {
  // Match only internationalized pathnames
  matcher: ["/", "/(de|en|fr)/:path*"],
};
```

Import the locales from the i18n config file you created earlier and the CreateMiddleware function from next-intl.

Inside the CreateMiddlware function, you can specify all the options you want to have.

Check out the next-intl [documentation](https://next-intl-docs.vercel.app/docs/routing/middleware) for more information.

## Use the Translation

All the configurations are done.

Now, let’s see how to use the translation on a Client Component.

### Client component

To use the translation on a Client Component, you must wrap your Layout with `NextIntlClientProvider`.

And pass the messages as props to use on the Client components.

```jsx
import "./globals.css";
import { NextIntlClientProvider } from "next-intl";
import { getMessages } from "next-intl/server";
import LangSwitcher from "@/components/LangSwitcher";

export default async function LocaleLayout({
  children,
  params: { locale },
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode,
  params: { locale: string },
}) {
  // Providing all messages to the client
  // side is the easiest way to get started
  const messages = await getMessages();

  return (
    <html lang={locale}>
      <body>
        <NextIntlClientProvider messages={messages}>
          <LangSwitcher />
          {children}
        </NextIntlClientProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

Here is an example of using translation on a client component.

```jsx
import { useTranslations } from "next-intl";

export default function Index() {
  const t = useTranslations("Index");

  return (
    <div className="container text-center my-5 mx-auto">
      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold">{t("title")}</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

First, import the **`useTranslations`** hook from **next-intl** and \*\*\*\*then call it by the object name.
It will provide the associated translations.

You can add more translations like this:

```jsx
{
  "Index": {
    "title": "Hallo Welt"
  },
  {
   "About": {
	   "title": "About Us"
	   ...
   }
  }
}

```

This way you can use the translations on a Client Component.

Let’s see how to use the translation on a Server Component.

### Server component

For the server component, you don’t have to configure anything else.

Just import `getTranslations` and call it with the translation object key.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { getTranslations } from "next-intl/server";

const AboutPage = async () => {
  const t = await getTranslations("About");
  return (
    <div className="container text-center my-5 mx-auto">
      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold">{t("title")}</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

export default AboutPage;
```

This is how you can use translations on a Server Component.

Now to test our translations let’s create a language switcher.

## Language switcher

Create a file named **LangSwitcher.tsx** in the components folder.

And paste this code into that file.

```jsx
"use client";
import Link from "next/link";
import { usePathname } from "next/navigation";
import { locales } from "@/i18n";

const LangSwitcher = () => {
  const pathName = usePathname();

  const redirectedPathName = (locale: string) => {
    if (!pathName) return "/";
    const segments = pathName.split("/");
    segments[1] = locale;
    return segments.join("/");
  };

  return (
    <div className="flex space-x-10 justify-center my-5">
      {locales.map((locale) => (
        <Link
          key={locale}
          href={redirectedPathName(locale)}
          className="capitalize hover:underline hover:text-blue-500"
        >
          {locale}
        </Link>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};

export default LangSwitcher;
```

This is the language switcher for your Next.js application. It dynamically generates links for each locale in the `locales` array, modifying the current path to reflect the selected locale.

When a user clicks on a locale link, they are redirected to the same page but in the chosen language.
